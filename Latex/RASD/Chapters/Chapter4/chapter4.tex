\chapter{Formal Analysis Using Alloy}

In this chapter is shown the use of Alloy to analyze the critical parts of the system. In particular the most crucial points to analyze are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Only No-Tech Customer can enter with the Ticket.
	\item Customer can enter with a Line-Up or Booking Request.
	\item Customer can be involved in one started Request per time. \\
\end{itemize}
All the others Signatures and Facts are used to simplify the model in some cases or to help the building of the model in others.
In particular section 4.1 lists and explains all the Signatures used , section 4.2 all the Facts of the model and the last section 4.4 shows an example of world with Alloy's Predicates.
