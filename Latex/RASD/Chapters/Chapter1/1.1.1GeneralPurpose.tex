\subsection{General Purpose}

Customer Line-Up is a crowdsourced application whose purpose is to create a service to support people, specially in lockdown time, in doing grocery shopping. The aim is, on the one side, to allow store managers to regulate the influx of people in the building and, on the other side, to save people from having to line up and stand outside of stores for hours on end.\\
Customer Line-Up is very simple to be usable by everyone. The softwareâ€™s main features are to allow customer to line-up from their home and to notify them when they have to go towards the store according the time they need to get to the supermarket. In addition, the system generates QR codes that would be scanned at the entrance and the exit of the store, thus allowing store managers to monitor entrances.\\
Moreover, CLup allows customers to book a visit to the supermarket indicating when and the approximate expected duration of the visit or, only for long-term users, this last one can be inferred by the system. In addition, the customer can indicate, if not the exact list of items that they intend to purchase, the categories of items that they intend to buy to allow the application to plan visits in a finer way.\\
