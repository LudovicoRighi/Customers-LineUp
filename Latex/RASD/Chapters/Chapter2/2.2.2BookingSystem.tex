\subsection{Booking}

This part of the whole system manages the action of booking a Visit for a specific supermarket. The Customer uses the mobile phone interface to make a Booking Request indicating the involved supermarket, the date and time of the Visit and its Expected Duration. If the Customer is a Long-Term one, the system can mine this last parameter from previous data.\\
Additionally, the Customer can indicate the exact list of items he intends to buy or their categories to enable the system to make a finer optimization allowing more people in the store.\\
The system shows only dates and times when the supermarket is open and the number of its Bookings is lower than its capacity.
It is important to underline that the system allows the Customer to make a single Booking Request at a time to permit a more fair distribution of the timeslots available. Also, for usage semplicity reasons, it permits only to cancel and not to modify the Request.
