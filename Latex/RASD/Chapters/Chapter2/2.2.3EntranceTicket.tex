\subsection{Entrance with Ticket}

This modality is permitted only if the Customer does not have the possibility to reach the technology needed, for example, he has not the ability to use a smartphone or has not the financial possibility to buy it. When a No-Tech Customer arrives at the supermarket, the Store Manager uses his dedicated portal to report him to let the system update the queue. Then, if the supermarket is not full, the Store Manager hand out the ticket to the No-Tech Customer which can immediately enter; otherwise, the system generates the Ticket with the waiting time, which indicates when the No-Tech Customer is allowed to enter. 
Finally, the Store Manager has to indicate to the system when the No-Tech Customer exits the supermarket to update the number of people inside it.
