\section{Product Perspective}
CLup is a new product whose intent is to help people and store managers during this pandemic caused by Covid-19. In particular, it is a self-contained product: it includes almost all subsystems needed to fulfil the requirements defined in this document, except for two APIs provided by Google, which will be briefly described later. However, any detailed definition of an external system is out of scope of this document.\\
In the following two subsections it is defined the domain through different models: in particular, the section 2.1.1 shows the Class Diagram, while in the section 2.1.2 the most relevant Statecharts Diagrams are represented.
