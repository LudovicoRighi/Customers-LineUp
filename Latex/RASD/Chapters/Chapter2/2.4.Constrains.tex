\section{Constraints}

The current constraints on the project are related to the provision of hardware resources to run some of the software's main features.\\
Firstly, to guarantee the effectiveness of the Real-Time Queue, when Customers want to send a Line-Up Requests, they must provide their geographical position: the devices without a GPS are excluded from the lining-up mechanism. The same exclusion is also for Customers who, even if they have devices provided with a GPS, did not grant the localization permission to the application. Clearly, the system will have to ask for Customers' permission in order to retrieve and use their positions and will store those informations only for the period of time strictly needed, discarding them as soon as the Customer scans the QR code.\\
Secondly, all the services offered by the system are accessible only through an Internet connection, which is obviously indispensable for the different functionalities.\\ 
Finally, all the devices with processors that does not support the execution of inference algorithms cannot run the function that predicts the expected duration of the visit for Long-Term Customers.
