\section{Performance Requirements}

The purpose of this section is to outline the Performance objectvies for the application to be implemented. In particular, with respect to the Response Time, the CLup must be able to send feedbacks within 2 seconds. Moreover, it is important to underline the fact that, since the application is thought for being used by a very large amount of people, ideally by every single person, the system must be capable to support at least 300 000 users simultaneously. This Workload problem will be addressed in the Design phase, but it is evident that a load balancer and multiple replicated servers will be needed.
