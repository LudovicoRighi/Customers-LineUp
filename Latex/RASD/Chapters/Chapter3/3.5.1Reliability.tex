\subsection{Reliability}

Firstly, the line-up mechanism should be very effective in order to avoid that customers arrives to the grocery store after his/her number is called, or too early, as in this case we would get back into a physical line situation. For this reason, the system provides an estimation of the customer waiting time with a maximum error of 3 minutes and alert them taking into account the time they need to get to the shop from the place they are and their mean of transport.\\
Finally, it must guarantee a consistency of the bookings stored inside the system.
