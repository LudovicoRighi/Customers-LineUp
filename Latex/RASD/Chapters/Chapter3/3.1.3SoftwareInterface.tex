\subsection{Software Interfaces}

The system uses the Google Mapâ€™s APIs, in particular:
\begin{itemize}
	\item GOOGLE MAPS GEOLOCATION API: to find the exact locations of the customers.
	\item GOOGLE MAPS DISTANCE MATRIX API: to get informations about the recommended route and the duration of the trip (driving, public transportation, walking or cycling) while considering the current traffic situation.
\end{itemize}
