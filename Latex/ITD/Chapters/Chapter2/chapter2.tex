\chapter{Implemented goals and requirements}


In this chapter all the requirements and main functions that are implemented in the prototype are presented. They are listed below:\\
\textbf{Goals:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item $G_1$ : Customers can line-up from their home to access the supermarket.
	\item $G_3$ : Customers are notified when they have to go towards the store according the time they need to get to the supermarket. 
	\item $G_4$ : Customers entrances are monitored and managed by the system.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Requirements:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item $R_1$ : The System retrieves the GPS position of the Customer.
	\item $R_2$ : The System sends the QR code for the entrance.
	\item $R_3$ : The Customer indicates with which mean of transport he intends to go to the supermarket.
	\item $R_4$ : The Customer indicates the supermarket in which he wants to go.
	\item $R_5$ : The System shows the Customer his Waiting Time.
	\item $R_{10}$ : The System computes the time needed for the Customer to reach the supermarket based on his currently GPS position and on his mean of transport.
	\item $R_{11}$ : The System notifies the Customer when he have to start.
	\item $R_{12}$ : Customers scan their QR code when they both enter or exit from the supermarket.
	\item $R_{13}$ : The System computes the Waiting Time considering the Real-Time Queue.
	\item $R_{17}$ : The System updates the Real-Time Queue.
\end{itemize}
