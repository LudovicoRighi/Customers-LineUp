\section{Frameworks and Programming Languages}

\subsection{Application Server}

The language used to develop the Application Server is Java.  It has been chosen because it offers an easy scalability and maintainability of the system. In particular, the library JAX-RS has been used to build the APIs of the Restful Server  and JPA has been used to manage the connection with the database. Finally, JUnit has been used for the testing.

\subsection{Database}

Customer LineUp database is build upon MySQL. It has been chosen for its reliability and its excellent integration with JPA.

\subsection{Mobile Application (For Customers)}

Customer LineUp Mobile Application was developed with JavaScript language and with React-Native framework. This choice has been taken because React Native lets create truly native applications for all the main mobile OSs. This choice was made because the catchment area envisaged for CLup covers the entire demographic range and, in this way, we can provide as soon as possible a multi-platform application useful to people in an emergency period. Furthermore, thanks to its atomic component structure, the development of unit tests is easier and faster.
