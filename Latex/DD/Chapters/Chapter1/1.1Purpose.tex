\section{Purpose}

The purpose of this document is to give a more detailed description of the architectural choices made to perform into the software system all the functionalities described into the RASD document.
Therefore, if the RASD describes all the features that the system must indulge according to the stakeholders needs, the DD describes how it has been thought to convert all the high-level system requirements into the design structure.
It provides guidance and material which is intended to assist technical staff to perform system testing and implementation and, moreover, to facilitate future maintenance and features extension.
List of topics covered by the document:
\begin{itemize}
	\item High-level architecture.
	\item Main Components, interfaces and deployment.
	\item Runtime behavior.
	\item Design Patterns.
	\item UI details.
	\item Mapping between requirements and architecture.
	\item Implementation, integration and testing plan.
\end{itemize}
