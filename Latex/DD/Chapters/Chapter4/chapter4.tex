\chapter{Requirements Traceability}
This chapter presents the mapping between the requirements, defined in the RASD document in order to achieve the prefixed goals, and the components introduced in the Component Diagram. This task is important because it permits to check whether all requirements have been considered and to control that every component is used at least one time. Moreover, in this way it is also possible to ensure that a proper modularity and separation of concerns of the components have been reached during the Design phase.
