\section{Component Interfaces} 
In the following diagram are described the main methods which can be invoked on the interfaces and their interactions, referring to the most important processes reported in the Runtime View section.\\
One aspect is fundamental to be pointed out: in general, methods written in the Component Interfaces diagram are not to be intended exactly as the methods that the developers will write, but they are a logical representation of what component interfaces have to offer. They will be adapted facing the various aspects that will come out during the implementation of the code.
